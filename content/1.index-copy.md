I haven’t a clue when I’d ever come to find out how. For until this very day, I still feel like a child at times. I largely refuse to grow up. Partly because I see the people who did, the expression on their faces is akin to someone who’d just been scammed by an Indian call-center operative. Partly because, deep down I still sense there’s something there. Something that calls for suspension of disbelief. Something worth remaining a dreamer for, no matter how much this world tries to convert you into a cynic. Something of wonder, in a jaded world.

I know sometimes it’s hard to see magic in between the sameness of every day life and the challenges we face. But our journey together has been a sweet reminder of how things can happen unexpectedly, without boundary, vivid and all-consuming like that feeling when the first breeze of fall arrives after a hot summer came and went…
